# Viewing Party

This app allows you to organize and create movie viewing parties with your friends. All you need to do is register with an email address and then you can add friends, search for movies, and invite your friends to viewing parties! All of the movie information is provided by [the movie database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) so make sure to check out their site as well!
